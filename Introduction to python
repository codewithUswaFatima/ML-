LIBRARIES
1. NumPy
ðŸ“š What it is:
NumPy (Numerical Python) provides powerful data structures like arrays and matrices, along with functions to operate on them.

ðŸ”§ Why it's used in ML:

Fast operations on large datasets

Essential for handling numerical data

Underlies many other libraries (like Pandas, TensorFlow)

âœ… Example usage:
You use NumPy to scale or transform data, do matrix operations, and implement low-level ML algorithms.

2. Pandas
ðŸ“š What it is:
Pandas is a data manipulation and analysis library. Itâ€™s built on top of NumPy but offers more high-level structures like DataFrames.

ðŸ”§ Why it's used in ML:

Cleaning and preprocessing data

Handling missing values, filtering rows/columns

Converting data into a format suitable for modeling

âœ… Example usage:
You use Pandas to read CSV files, filter out rows, compute statistics, and prepare datasets before training.

3. Matplotlib / Seaborn
ðŸ“š What it is:

Matplotlib: A 2D plotting library.

Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib with a more attractive interface and easier syntax for statistical plots.

ðŸ”§ Why they're used in ML:

Visualizing data distributions

Plotting model performance (like loss curves, accuracy, etc.)

Creating correlation heatmaps

âœ… Example usage:
You use these libraries to understand the structure and distribution of your data, which helps in feature engineering and model tuning.

4. Scikit-learn (sklearn)
ðŸ“š What it is:
Scikit-learn is the most popular ML library for traditional (non-deep-learning) algorithms.

ðŸ”§ Why it's used in ML:

Tons of built-in models (like SVM, Random Forest, KNN, etc.)

Preprocessing tools (like scaling, encoding, train-test splitting)

Easy-to-use API for model training and evaluation

âœ… Example usage:
Train a model like LinearRegression or DecisionTreeClassifier with just a few lines of code.

5. TensorFlow / Keras
ðŸ“š What it is:

TensorFlow: An open-source deep learning framework by Google.

Keras: A high-level API running on top of TensorFlow, making it easier to define models.

ðŸ”§ Why it's used in ML:

Build and train deep neural networks

Great for complex tasks like image recognition, NLP, etc.

Scalable for production environments

âœ… Example usage:
Used for deep learning tasks with large datasets and custom architectures (like CNNs, RNNs, Transformers).

6. PyTorch
ðŸ“š What it is:
An open-source deep learning library developed by Facebook AI.

ðŸ”§ Why it's used in ML:

Dynamic computation graphs (great for debugging and experimentation)

Cleaner, more Pythonic syntax than TensorFlow

Widely used in research

âœ… Example usage:
Similar to TensorFlow, but preferred for rapid prototyping of deep learning models.
